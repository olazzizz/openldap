# Description
This is a clone of the work done here on the openldap container: https://github.com/osixia/docker-openldap/tree/stable/example/extend-osixia-openldap



I have just created my own bootstrapped schema for easy use and testing.

If you want to use the pre-configured docker image directly you can find it here:  https://hub.docker.com/r/johnowebb/openldap/
